        STR_Remake_BodyColor.msbt
            NOTE: Items with BodyColor remake labels will have a 'C' in front of them where they are listed in the Item folder (below). The 'C' will have a number after it, indicating the number of Color remakes. -- Ex: 'C8' means that the item has 8 labels (numbered 0-7) in the 'STR_Remake_BodyColor.msbt' file.
        STR_Remake_BodyParts.msbt
            NOTE: all items which have a 'C' next to them WILL have a BodyParts label. The name of this label (NOT THE CONTENTS OF THE LABEL) will be identically to its corresponding ItemName label. -- Ex: 'Axe_02514' is a label in ItemName with the contents 'silver axe,' but 'Axe_02514' is also a label found in BodyParts, with the contents "Color."
        STR_Remake_FabricColor.msbt
            NOTE: Items with FabricColor remake labels will have an 'F' in front of them where they are listed in the Item folder (below). The 'F' will have a number after it, indicating the number of Fabric remakes. -- Ex:, 'F5' means that the item has 5 labels (numbered 0-4) in the 'STR_Remake_FabricColor.msbt' file.
        STR_Remake_FabricParts.msbt
            NOTE: all items which have an 'F' next to them WILL have a FabricParts label. The name of this label (NOT THE CONTENTS OF THE LABEL) will be identically to its corresponding ItemName label. Ex: 'Ftr_04079' is a label in ItemName with the contents 'illuminated arch,' but 'Ftr_04079' is also a label found in FabricParts, with the contents "Name."
