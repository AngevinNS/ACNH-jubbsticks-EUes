It's already produced some shoots!

Your bamboo cultivation was a bit 
of a failure. It took a long time, 
and only produced a single shoot...
But I'm sure you'll be glad
that it's a PERFECT bamboo shoot!
Lucky you! Here it is!

Your perfect bamboo cultivation
failed! It sadly only produced a
single shoot in return...

We can always try to cultivate it 
again, if you'd like to!

The perfect bamboo cultivation
was a swift success! Your tree
already sprouted two whole shoots.
I hope they'll grow up as
nice and strong as they are happy!

I'm sorry to inform you that
your perfect bamboo cultivation 
order was a bit of a failure. 
It took a long time, but only
produced one shoot...
It's unfortunate how sensitive
perfect bamboo tends to be.
